#  ChatBot Application

This is a simple chat application built using Gradio that integrates with the Ollama API to generate responses based on user input. The application uses a chatbot interface to facilitate interaction.

## Features

- Chatbot interface for real-time text-based communication.
- Integration with the Ollama API for generating responses.
- User-friendly interface with text input and send button.

## Running a Gradio Chatbot with Ollama API

This guide describes how to set up and use a chatbot powered by Ollama's large language model (LLM) and visualized with Gradio.

### Ollama Setup

1. **Install Ollama:** Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Alternatively**, follow the manual installation instructions on Ollama's GitHub: [https://github.com/ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)

2. **Download and Run LLM Model:** Once installed, download and run a model. This example uses "llama3". Use the following command:

```bash
ollama run llama3
```

**Note:** Downloading the model can take a while, especially on the first run.

### Using the Chatbot Script (Separate File)

1. **Download the Script:** You'll need a Python script that interacts with Ollama and Gradio to create the chatbot interface. Locate a script online or write your own (resources for creating the script are available online).

2. **Save the Script:** Save the downloaded script as a Python file (e.g., `chatbot.py`).

3. **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install gradio requests
```

4. **Update Ollama API URL:** The script might include a placeholder for the Ollama API URL. Locate this section and replace it with the actual endpoint provided by Ollama after running the model.

5. **Run the Script:** Execute the script in your terminal using:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

### Launching the Chatbot Interface

If everything is set up correctly, this should launch a Gradio interface in your web browser. You should see a text box and a "Send" button.

### Using the Chatbot

1. Type a message in the text box.

2. Press Enter or click the "Send" button.

3. The chatbot will analyze your message, utilize the chat history to construct a prompt, and generate a response using Ollama's LLM.

4. The generated response will be displayed in the chat window.
